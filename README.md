# Training Piscine Data Science - 1 Data Warehouse

## Introduction

This project focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which is essential for data integration. ETL combines data from multiple sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse. Proper data management is crucial; even if a module is validated, issues may arise later if data is not cleaned or stored correctly.

## Why is Data Warehouse Relevant?

Understanding data warehousing is vital for data engineers, as it enables the effective organization and management of large datasets. This project provides hands-on experience in integrating and transforming data, which is essential for preparing data for analysis.

## Skills
- Data Integration
- Data Cleaning
- Database Management
- SQL Proficiency
- Data Analysis

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Show Me Your DB
- **Description**: A database visualization tool was utilized to easily visualize the database, allowing for user-friendly browsing and searching of IDs.
- **Relevance**: This exercise emphasizes the importance of being able to browse and manage data effectively.

### Exercise 01: Customers Table
- **Description**: All the `data_202*_***` tables were successfully joined together into a single table called "customers".
- **Relevance**: This exercise is crucial for understanding how to consolidate data from multiple sources into a unified structure.

### Exercise 02: Remove Duplicates
- **Description**: Duplicate rows in the "customers" table were identified and deleted, including rows that were sent multiple times in quick succession.
- **Relevance**: This exercise highlights the importance of data integrity and the need to maintain clean datasets.

### Exercise 03: Fusion
- **Description**: The "customers" table was combined with the "items" table, ensuring that no information was lost during the process.
- **Relevance**: This exercise reinforces the importance of data relationships and the need to integrate different datasets for comprehensive analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to the ETL process and the management of data warehouses. By completing these project, gain practical experience in data integration, cleaning, and organization, which are essential skills for any data engineer.
